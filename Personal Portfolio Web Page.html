   <p>Welcome to my personal website.</p><img src="IMG_3597__.jpg"alt="personal photo" width="250" height="250">
    
    <p>I have constructed it as part of the requirement for the Step8Up Bootcamp.</p>
    <p>My professional experience includes working for a major Utility supplier as a QA Engineer. During my time there I worked on a number of projects that included the implementation
     of smart meters in order to help customers reduce their energy consumption and in tandem reduce their energy costs.</p>
    <p>Previous to this I worked for a company that specialised in security systems, primarily entry/exit hardware and software that operated in world wide markets. One extremely important customer
    included the US Department of Defence for their Pentagon premises.</p>

    <p>In my personal time I'm quite active. One of my hobbies includes practising martial arts.</p>
    <p>The martial art that I practice is Aikido. I have been practising it for a number of years. I have trained all over the UK with eminent teachers including having the privilege to be trained
    with Japanese Sensei's directly from Aikido Hombu (HQ) in Tokyo Japan.</p>

    <p>If you would like contact myself for further information regarding my work experience or just a general chat about Aikido please feel free to email me. My address is <a href="mailto:a.kayani@live.co.uk">a.kayani@live.co.uk</a>
